# xplus

`xplus` provides **PLUS-derived extensions** for Positive and Unlabeled
Learning from Unbalanced Cases and Sparse Structures (Zhou et al.,
2022). This is the production release **1.0.1**, a major release with
breaking numerical and interface contracts. It is not a reproduction of
the paper’s experiments and does not establish predictive superiority or
guarantee calibrated probabilities.

## Installation

Install the production version from the production repository:

``` r

# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("alrobles/xplus")
```

R \>= 4.1.0 is required (the source uses the native pipe), and the
declared minimum glmnet version is 4.1-8. The verification environment
used R 4.5.2 and glmnet 5.0; the dependency minimum is not a claim that
other versions have been tested.

## What is PU learning?

Only known positives are labeled `1`; `0` means unlabeled, not a
confirmed negative. Unlabeled cases may contain both negatives and
hidden positives. The package iteratively constructs pseudo-labels and
fits penalized logistic models. Its response-scale outputs are model
scores in `[0, 1]`, not externally validated probabilities of the true
PU class.

## Basic workflow

``` r

library(xplus)
set.seed(1)
x <- matrix(rnorm(200 * 10), ncol = 10)
colnames(x) <- paste0("feature", seq_len(ncol(x)))
y <- c(rep(1, 40), rep(0, 160))

fit <- xplus(x, y, max_iter = 20, seed = 42)
head(predict(fit, x, type = "response"))  # positional newx is supported
levels(predict(fit, x, type = "class"))   # always "0", "1"
summary(fit)
fit$stop_reason
fit$fallback_used

# Illustration on training PU labels, not held-out true-class performance:
assess(fit, newx = x, newy = y, s = "lambda.1se")
get_auc(fit, newx = x, newy = y, s = "lambda.1se")
```

Use held-out, independently established truth to assess true-class
performance. The example’s random features are not a predictive-quality
fixture. A finite fitted model or reaching `max_iter` is not evidence of
convergence.

## Migrating from 0.1.x

### Inputs and prediction

- `learning_rate` must be in `(0, 1]`: **zero is rejected** rather than
  allowing a frozen update to appear stable.
- Fitting requires a finite numeric feature matrix with at least two
  columns and at least **three known positives and three unlabeled
  observations** for cross-validation. Labels must be binary; factors
  are interpreted by their `"0"`/`"1"` labels, not internal level codes.
- `predict(fit, newx, s = ..., type = ...)` accepts the new matrix
  positionally. Named training features require an exact set of
  nonempty, unique feature names in `newx`, which is reordered into
  training order. Missing, extra, duplicate or unnamed features are
  errors when training features are named. With unnamed training
  features, the column count and positional order are the caller’s
  responsibility. Non-finite features and unsupported `...` arguments
  are rejected.
- Single-lambda class predictions are factors with fixed levels
  `c("0", "1")`, even when only one class is predicted. Multiple numeric
  lambdas return a dimension-preserving 0/1 class matrix. Classification
  uses `probability > fit$cutoff`.
- `s` is respected for both training and new-data predictions: choose
  exactly `"lambda.min"`, `"lambda.1se"`, or finite nonnegative numeric
  lambdas. Cache-only legacy objects support only `"lambda.min"` without
  `newx`.
  [`get_auc()`](https://alrobles.github.io/xplus/reference/get_auc.md)
  forwards prediction arguments, including `s`, and requires a single
  lambda;
  [`assess()`](https://alrobles.github.io/xplus/reference/assess.md)
  supports per-lambda results.

### Strict metrics

- Truth must be finite binary 0/1 labels, or a finite nonnegative
  two-column matrix of **negative and positive class masses**, such as
  `cbind(1 - p, p)` for soft truth. Soft probability vectors are not
  accepted as binary truth.
  [`auc_matrix()`](https://alrobles.github.io/xplus/reference/auc_matrix.md)
  uses the two-column representation;
  [`get_auc()`](https://alrobles.github.io/xplus/reference/get_auc.md)
  uses binary truth through
  [`auc()`](https://alrobles.github.io/xplus/reference/auc.md).
- Optional row weights must be numeric, finite, nonnegative and have
  exactly one entry per observation; there is no recycling. Invalid
  observations are errors, not silently dropped rows, including when
  their weights are zero.
- [`auc()`](https://alrobles.github.io/xplus/reference/auc.md) and
  [`auc_matrix()`](https://alrobles.github.io/xplus/reference/auc_matrix.md)
  rank finite scores, including scores outside `[0, 1]`; assessment uses
  response probabilities. Undefined AUC (zero positive or negative
  effective class mass) returns `NA` with a warning. Zero total
  effective weight/mass likewise makes assessment metrics undefined.
  Tied scores use half credit in AUC; constant scores with both classes
  present have AUC 0.5.
- MSE and MAE sum the losses for **both class columns**, so they are
  **twice the scalar binary loss**. For class masses, normalize each row
  to proportions and weight by its total mass as well as its supplied
  row weight. Deviance clips predictions to `[1e-5, 1 - 1e-5]`; this
  clipping is specific to the deviance calculation, not a global
  modification of predictions.

## Algorithm and stopping contract

The paper’s algorithm, its authors’ reference implementation, and this
package’s extensions are distinct. The reference implementation already
uses replacement sampling followed by deduplication, sampling budgets
and learning-rate smoothing; these are not all new inventions of this
package.

1.  Sample unlabeled cases with replacement and fit penalized binomial
    models alongside known positives. The new default
    `sampling = "bootstrap"` preserves draw multiplicities as **case
    weights** on unique rows. Each identity is assigned to only one CV
    fold, preventing copies of one observation leaking between training
    and validation. `sampling = "unique"` opts into legacy
    deduplication; it does not restore every 0.1.x default.
2.  `sample_use_time` limits the number of **completed inclusion rounds
    per unlabeled identity**, not the number of bootstrap draws. An
    identity appearing several times in one round spends one budget
    unit. `sampling_counts` records inclusion rounds; `draw_counts`
    records multiplicities.
3.  `cv_measure = "deviance"` is the default in **both iterative and
    final fits**. `"auc"` is opt-in and explicitly falls back to
    deviance for small samples (fewer than 10 observations per fold on
    average), with a warning and effective iterative measures in
    `history`. Requested folds are reduced to available class counts.
    Sampled iterative labels must support at least three unique
    observations per class; up to **20 retries** precede
    `stop_reason = "degenerate_labels"`.
4.  Anchor predictions at the positive-reference `qq` quantile,
    normalize residuals, and apply a sigmoid. `sigmoid_scale = 10` is
    now independently configurable; public `alpha` remains glmnet’s
    elastic-net mixture and is **not** the sigmoid scale from the paper.
5.  `learning_rate = 1` retains the `"current"` path, updating sampled
    unlabeled cases with Bernoulli training labels.
    `0 < learning_rate < 1` still selects the package’s
    `"continuous_enhancement"` path: it smooths probabilities globally
    and hard-thresholds all unlabeled **iterative training labels**.
    Both paths use soft targets for the final fit.
6.  Stability uses `1 - mean(abs(mapped_score - previous_pseudo_label))`
    across **all unlabeled cases before learning-rate damping**.
    Defaults `min_iter = 5`, `stability_window = 5`, and
    `min_coverage = 0.9` require at least five iterations, a full window
    of five consecutive scores **strictly above**
    `convergence_threshold`, and 90% inclusion coverage. A small
    learning rate alone cannot manufacture convergence.

Inspect `stop_reason`, `n_iter`, `history`, and sampling counts.
`"label_stability"` denotes the stated heuristic; `"budget_exhausted"`,
`"max_iter"` and `"degenerate_labels"` describe different stopping
conditions, not equivalent successes.

### Final targets, fallback and random seeds

Fractional binomial responses `cbind(1 - p, p)` are valid. Soft targets
may all exceed 0.5 without being degenerate: final fallback is **not**
decided by hard-label counts. Effective positive and negative mass is
checked on the full data and **every CV training split**, using a mean
positive proportion strictly between `1e-5` and `1 - 1e-5`.

If proposed soft targets fail that guard, final fitting falls back to
the original PU labels with a warning and explicit
`fallback_used`/`fallback_reason`. `original_y` stores input labels,
`pseudo_labels` stores the proposed pre-fallback probabilities, and
`final_labels` and `y` agree with the actual final fitting targets. The
object also stores `history`, `sampling_counts`, `draw_counts` and
`final_foldid` for diagnostics. If original labels cannot support the
required class mass either, fitting errors.

Supplying `seed` creates a local reproducible run and restores the
caller’s previous RNG state (including absence of `.Random.seed`). It
does not reset the external RNG stream. With `seed = NULL`, normal
caller-controlled RNG behavior applies.

## Verification

Run package tests and inspect the reported **FAIL/WARN/SKIP counts**; an
exit code alone is not a pass criterion:

``` bash
OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1 OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 Rscript -e 'devtools::test(stop_on_failure = TRUE)'
```

For a full `R CMD check`, build and check from a temporary directory:

``` bash
repo="$PWD"
check_dir="$(mktemp -d)"
(cd "$check_dir" && R CMD build "$repo" && R CMD check xplus_1.0.0.tar.gz)
```

Audit harnesses, historical baselines and candidate diagnostics are
maintained in a separate private repository and are not included in the
production source tree.
