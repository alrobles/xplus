# Internal helper: normalize anchor residuals for the PLUS transformation.
#
# After subtracting the positive-reference quantile cutoff, predicted
# probabilities become signed residuals (`map_pred_y`).  This function
# normalises each side independently so that the maximum positive residual
# maps to +1 and the most-negative residual maps to -1 before the sigmoid
# `1 / (1 + exp(-10 * map_pred_y))` is applied.
#
# Near-degenerate case: if all positive (or all negative) residuals are
# smaller in magnitude than `degenerate_threshold`, those residuals are
# clamped to 0 and a warning is issued.  Clamping to 0 yields a neutral
# prediction of exactly 0.5 from the downstream sigmoid, which is
# deterministic and explicitly documented.
#
# @param map_pred_y Numeric vector of residuals (pred_y - cutoff).
# @param degenerate_threshold Positive scalar.  Residuals whose maximum
#   absolute value falls below this limit are treated as near-degenerate.
#   Defaults to 1e-6.
# @return Numeric vector of the same length as `map_pred_y` with
#   normalised (or clamped) residuals.
