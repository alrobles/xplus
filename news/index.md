# Changelog

## xplus 1.0.0

This is a major, breaking upgrade of the PLUS-derived package
extensions, not an exact reproduction of the paper or evidence of
predictive superiority. Response-scale model scores are not guaranteed
to be calibrated probabilities. The package remains `xplus`; the
production repository is <https://github.com/alrobles/xplus>.
Development, audit harnesses and historical baselines live in the
development repository <https://github.com/alrobles/xplus-develeopment>.

### Breaking interfaces and metrics

- Require R \>= 4.1.0 for native-pipe syntax and declare glmnet \>=
  4.1-8. Verification uses R 4.5.2 / glmnet 5.0; other supported
  versions have not thereby been verified.
- Reject `learning_rate = 0`; the accepted interval is `(0, 1]`.
- Interpret binary factors by labels, not level codes. Single-lambda
  class predictions now have fixed factor levels `"0"`, `"1"`; multiple
  lambdas retain a 0/1 matrix. Classification uses a strict
  `> object$cutoff` comparison.
- Accept positional `newx` in
  [`predict()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/predict.html). Validate finite
  numeric features; named training features require an exact set of
  nonempty unique prediction names and are automatically aligned. Reject
  mismatches and unsupported dots.
- Respect `s` for training and new-data prediction, including numeric
  lambdas. Cache-only objects support only `"lambda.min"` without new
  data.
  [`get_auc()`](https://alrobles.github.io/xplus/reference/get_auc.md)
  forwards prediction arguments and requires one lambda;
  [`assess()`](https://alrobles.github.io/xplus/reference/assess.md) can
  return per-lambda metrics.
- Require finite binary truth, or finite nonnegative two-column
  negative/positive masses for soft truth or counts
  ([`assess()`](https://alrobles.github.io/xplus/reference/assess.md)/[`auc_matrix()`](https://alrobles.github.io/xplus/reference/auc_matrix.md)).
  Soft vectors are not binary truth. Weights must be finite, nonnegative
  and row-aligned, without recycling. Invalid rows are errors, not
  silently dropped observations.
- Undefined AUC returns `NA` with a warning when either effective class
  mass is zero. Zero effective total mass/weight makes assessment
  undefined. Ties receive half credit; constant scores with both classes
  have AUC 0.5.
- MSE and MAE retain the two-class-column loss convention: twice scalar
  binary loss. Class-mass totals contribute to effective row weights.
  Deviance clips probabilities to `[1e-5, 1 - 1e-5]`; other metrics do
  not inherit that clipping.

### Sampling, CV and stopping

- Default `sampling = "bootstrap"` preserves replacement multiplicities
  as case weights on unique rows. Duplicate identities never cross CV
  folds. `sampling = "unique"` retains legacy deduplication, not all
  legacy behavior.
- `sample_use_time` is a budget of completed inclusion **rounds per
  identity**, not bootstrap draws. Record both `sampling_counts` and
  `draw_counts`.
- Default `cv_measure = "deviance"` in both iterative and final fitting
  stages. AUC remains opt-in, with an explicit warning and deviance
  fallback for fewer than 10 observations per fold on average; iterative
  effective measures appear in `history`.
- Require at least three positive and three unlabeled input
  observations. Reduce requested folds to available class counts;
  require three unique members of each iterative training class and
  retry degenerate samples at most 20 times before reporting
  `stop_reason = "degenerate_labels"`.
- Preserve the selected global-update, hard-thresholded iterative
  training path when `learning_rate < 1`; `learning_rate = 1` uses
  sampled Bernoulli updates. Final targets remain soft in both paths.
  Reference sampling budgets and smoothing should not be mistaken for
  newly invented package extensions.
- Expose `sigmoid_scale = 10` separately from glmnet elastic-net
  `alpha`.
- Default `min_iter = 5`, `stability_window = 5`, `min_coverage = 0.9`.
  Stability compares undamped mapped scores against previous
  pseudo-labels over all unlabeled cases. A full window of consecutive
  scores strictly above `convergence_threshold` and minimum coverage are
  required; damping alone cannot create convergence. Record `max_iter`,
  `budget_exhausted`, `degenerate_labels` and `label_stability`
  distinctly rather than implying every stop is success.

### Final fitting and reproducibility

- Validate effective class mass on the full final dataset and every CV
  training split (mean positive proportion strictly within `1e-5` and
  `1 - 1e-5`). Soft labels all above 0.5 remain valid when mass is
  sufficient; hard-class counts do not trigger final fallback.
- Warn when reverting to original PU labels and record `fallback_used`
  and `fallback_reason`. Preserve `original_y`, proposed
  `pseudo_labels`, actual `final_labels`/`y`, iteration `history`,
  sampling/draw counts and `final_foldid`. Insufficient original-label
  mass is an error, not a hidden recovery.
- Isolate an explicit `seed` from the caller’s RNG stream and restore
  its prior state, including when no `.Random.seed` existed.

### Documentation and verification

- Regenerate reference manuals from current roxygen contracts.
  Installation examples target `alrobles/xplus` without embedded
  credentials.
- Diagnostic harnesses, the historical numerical-audit baseline and
  candidate diagnostics are maintained in the development repository
  <https://github.com/alrobles/xplus-develeopment>; they are not part of
  the production source tree.
- Document `Rscript -e 'devtools::test(stop_on_failure = TRUE)'` and
  require inspection of FAIL/WARN/SKIP counts. Keep build/check output
  outside the tracked checkout.

## xplus 0.1.1

- Fixed a crash when the pseudo-labels of the iterative training subset
  collapse to a single class: fitting now stops cleanly with
  `stop_reason = "degenerate_labels"` instead of failing inside
  [`glmnet::cv.glmnet()`](https://glmnet.stanford.edu/reference/cv.glmnet.html).
- Sampling probabilities are now clamped at zero when the
  unlabeled-sampling budget is decremented, and sampling is skipped once
  the budget is fully exhausted (avoids an uninformative
  [`sample()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/sample.html) error).

## xplus 0.1.0

- Initial release.
- Implements the PLUS algorithm for positive-unlabeled learning (Zhou et
  al., 2022, <doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009956>).
- Provides
  [`xplus()`](https://alrobles.github.io/xplus/reference/xplus.md)
  fitting function with iterative pseudo-label updates.
- S3 methods: [`predict()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/predict.html),
  [`coef()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/coef.html),
  [`summary()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/summary.html),
  [`print()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/print.html),
  [`assess()`](https://alrobles.github.io/xplus/reference/assess.md),
  [`get_auc()`](https://alrobles.github.io/xplus/reference/get_auc.md),
  and
  [`get_predictions()`](https://alrobles.github.io/xplus/reference/get_predictions.md).
- Ships bundled datasets: `lacs`, `lacsSample`, and `binexample`.
